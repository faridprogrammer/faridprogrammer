I’m Farid Bekran, a passionate software developer and technical leader with over 11 years of experience in building scalable, high-quality software solutions. I specialize in .NET/C# development, but my work spans a wide range of technologies, including microservices, DevOps practices, and modern front-end frameworks like React and Angular.
